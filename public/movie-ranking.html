 <h1>The Best Movies According to Noah</h1>

 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

 <hr/>

 <h3>1. Dune Part 2</h3>
 <p>The ultimate sci-fi epic. It was surreal to watch after the anticipation built up by reading the book and watching 
    Dune Part 1 two years prior.</p>
 <h3>2. The Batman</h3>
 <p>The atmosphere of this movie was amazing. I finally got a gritty mainstream superhero movie. The costume design was awesome too.</p>
 <h3>3. Paranormal Activity</h3>
 <p>This movie is really fun to watch with family. I was so scared the first time I watched it and the ending(s) does(do) not disappoint.</p>
